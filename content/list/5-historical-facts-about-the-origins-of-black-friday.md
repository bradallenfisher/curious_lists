## The Historical Tapestry Behind Black Friday

Black Friday, the name evokes images of crowded stores and marked-down electronics, but its origins are as complex as they are intriguing.

### From Gold Panic to Shopping Manic

The initial use of "Black Friday" was far from the retail holiday we know today. It was not associated with sales or shopping but was a term used to describe the U.S. gold market crash on September 24, 1869. Two notorious Wall Street financiers, Jay Gould and Jim Fisk, tried to corner the gold market on the New York Gold Exchange, which led to widespread panic when the bubble burst. It would take nearly a century for the term to shed its gloomy financial connotations and be linked with consumerism.

### A Game and a Name

Post-Thanksgiving shopping in the United States was intertwined with the annual Army-Navy football game. The event, held on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, drew large crowds into the city, and retailers soon recognized the potential to boost their sales. They took advantage of the increased foot traffic to attract customers, laying the foundation for what would become Black Friday as we know it.

### A Term Is Born in Philadelphia

The actual term "Black Friday" to describe the post-Thanksgiving shopping mayhem was coined by the Philadelphia police in the 1950s. Officers used it to describe the chaotic day due to the heavy traffic and crowds that the shopping frenzy brought to the city. Despite its negative origins, the term stuck and began to spread beyond Philadelphia.

### The Rebranding of Black Friday

With the rise of the digital age and global marketing, Black Friday has transcended American borders. Now, stores around the world use the American Thanksgiving marker as a kickoff for holiday sales. It has become an international signifier of deep discounts and the beginning of the shopping season across the globe.
