The **Therapeutic Effect** of abstract painting is particularly notable, as it allows for an uncensored outpouring of feelings.

**Sculpting the Self** involves a hands-on method that engages the senses and invites a dialogue between the artist and the material. Through the act of sculpting, one can physically manipulate their thoughts and feelings, turning the intangible into something concrete.
