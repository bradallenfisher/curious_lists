1. **The Dual Role of Clinical Psychologists** {style="counter-reset: list 0;"}
  - **Significance:** Clinical psychologists possess both therapeutic expertise and research training.
  - **Benefit:** Their unique position allows them to conduct high-quality research projects.
  - **Challenge:** Despite their skills, research activity in practice remains low.

2. **Advantages of Research in Clinical Practice** {style="counter-reset: list 1;"}
  - **Evidence:** Research in clinical practice improves clinical performance and health outcomes.
  - **Training Model:** UK clinical psychologists are trained in the ‘scientist-practitioner model’.

3. **The Importance of Research Leadership** {style="counter-reset: list 2;"}
  - **Impact:** Research leadership ensures the profession's visibility and influence within health settings.
  - **Clinical Implications:** Clinical settings fostering research are linked to better patient outcomes.
  - **Recommendation:** Increase the feasibility of research projects in clinical settings.

4. **Barriers to Research in Practice** {style="counter-reset: list 3;"}
  - **Challenges:** Prioritization of clinical roles, lack of protected time, and funding issues.
  - **Statistics:** Over 80% cite lack of time or clinical work pressures as barriers.
  - **Funding Concern:** Much of the research in the NHS is unfunded.

5. **The Power of Collaboration** {style="counter-reset: list 4;"}
  - **Benefit:** Collaboration can reduce demands on an individual researcher.
  - **Engagement:** Projects benefit from visibility and legitimacy through collaboration.
  - **Recommendation:** Foster collaborations within or across services and with academic institutions.

6. **The Role of Deadlines and Monitoring** {style="counter-reset: list 5;"}
  - **Importance:** Setting deadlines helps maintain progress and prevent neglect.
