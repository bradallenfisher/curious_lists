Prolonged eye contact can indicate interest or dominance, while avoiding someone‚Äôs gaze might signal dishonesty or discomfort. Recognizing the **Intensity** and **Frequency** of eye contact, as well as instances of **Avoidance**, can tell us much about a person‚Äôs confidence, intentions, and emotional state.
